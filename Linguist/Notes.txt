* Probably want standard and user language files
	- look in user first
	- don't overwrite styles file (or maybe have two of these?)
* Changes to these files need to be live.
	- be sure to log rehups
* Uninstall the old version and install the new version.
* Compile the mondo regexen.
* Review TODOs.
* Create a README.
* Add a reference to this to the language ref doc.

* May want to use a weak list to avoid doing a snapshot -> doc -> extension -> language search every time.
* Replace IronPython with Linguist?
* May want to add a shebang option to language files:
	- would need to cache this information if it is found in a snapshot
* Use reflection to init ms_elements.
* Add more elements?
* Can we log somewhere if there are errors in the static Languages ctor?
	- event log?
* Add to the studio addins site?
* Send email to freshmeat or somewhere?
* Might want to add an optional global field to default style which would cause it to be applied to all
  text documents (not just the ones with a matching language).
* Would be nice to get multi-line elements (like C-style comments) working:
	- doesn't seem possible to get the entire text
