* Commit an html version of the readme
* Remove the readme.txt file.
* Log file should be log.txt
* The addon manager has a lame description of linguist.
* Can we add the readme to the solution?
* Make sure that github uses the readme.
* Add review language element names to release checklist.
* Add a dot file language. See http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html
* Add a reference to this to the language ref doc.
* Create a release checklist.
* Make an annoucement somewhere?
* Add it to the official list of studio 3rd party addons?

* May want to use a weak list to avoid doing a snapshot -> doc -> extension -> language search every time
	- make sure that this cache is reset on rehup
* May want to add a shebang option to language files:
	- would need to cache this information if it is found in a snapshot
* Use reflection to init ms_elements.
* Add more elements?
* Can we log somewhere if there are errors in the static Languages ctor?
	- event log?
* Add to the studio addins site?
* Send email to freshmeat or somewhere?
* Might want to add an optional global field to default style which would cause it to be applied to all
  text documents (not just the ones with a matching language).
* Would be nice to get multi-line elements (like C-style comments) working:
	- doesn't seem possible to get the entire text 
	- usually get called with spans consisting of one line
* Would be really nice to have the styles.field file be live:
	- styles are handled by the format classes which are instantiated by the editor
	- saving these into a list when they are created and updating them later had no effect
	- so seems that we would have to somehow tell the editor that the formats have changed
* Release checklist:
	- make sure that the language element names listed in the readme are correct
